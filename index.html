    <h1>The Sport of Squash</h1>

            <!-- Main Overview of squash -->
            <h3>Main Overview</h3>
            <p>The feeling of accomplishment and superiority when you have persevered and done something despite all of your opponentâ€™s efforts to stop you is what every player has always trained and played for. For me, squash does this better than other sports. It combines the physical, grueling nature of a sport through its long intense rallies, with a highly strategic and mental aspect that many other sports lack. The strategy in squash can be compared to chess, as you use each shot similarly to a chess move, one by one forcing your opponent into an increasingly difficult situation.  This two-dimensionality of the sport doubles this feeling for me, as it is both a physical and mental victory.</p>

            <!-- History of squash overview -->
            <h3>The History of Squash</h3>
            <p>You are not far off if you think squash has evolved since its creation. Squash was invented in the 1800s as the combination of two prior games (titled racquets and fives) at the Harrow School in London, England. Fives is comparable to what modern day humans consider to be handball. Racquets was a quite simple game which just involved hitting a ball against one or two walls. There is much more rich history about the foundational aspects to squash. Squash grew in popularity throughout the 1800s with many English public schools building courts. Thus, squash began to spread. Still considered to be a niche sport, squash is considered to be quite popular and has a continuously growing presence. One of the major rule changes in squash focused on the scoring. On April 1st, 2009, the World Squash Federation voted to switch the scoring system to be 'Point-A-Rally' (PAR) to 11 points per game. At the time, this was consdiered a very radical change because on a global scale, squash had always been played by the 'Hand-in-Hand-out' system to 9 points. This significantly shortened the potential length of matches.</p>

    <h3>Personal Experience</h3>
    <div class="personal-exerience">
        <article>
            <!-- Personal experience overview -->
            <p>I am fortunate enough to have lots of personal experience playing squash. When I began playing squash in 7th grade, I viewed squash with a passive attitude. I never played in many tournaments throughout my younger years because I did not have a focused mindset towards squash. Accordingly, I did not have much junior squash experience. Rather, I just played for fun and occaisionally, I would go to squash camps during the summer. There is something about summer squash camps that make them so entertaining as a young kid. There is no pressure to perform at a high level, and a good portion of the squash is designed to include fun activities and games instead of drills. However, as I grew older, I realized that squash camps are a great way to showcase your skills to college coaches and get your name out there. When I started highschool, I really began focusing on squash. I wholeheartedly enjoyed the team culture at my highschool as well as my teammates. Highschool squash is certainly a level above junior squash because a lot of junior squash players will go to a top-notch highschool and play for their team. For example, my freshman year roommate was our team's best player our junior and senior years. A great benefit to highschool squash is the exposure to better players, however, the downside is that you will not be able to compete in as many junior tournaments. Luckily, I have continued squash to this day and have enjoyed my college squash career. My freshman year of college, I walked-on to the Trinity College men's varsity squash team (historically and currently one of the best teams in all of college squash). Paul Assaiante, the coach of the Trinity squash team, is a legend when it comes to the squash world. He is a 17-time national champion with the best record in all of college sports; from February 1998 to January 2012, Assaiante and his team won 252 matches in a row resulting in 13 consecutive championships. Under the leadership of Coach Assaiante as well as the professional level of play, I am forever grateful for my experience playing squash at Trinity because I have gained so much experience and grown to be a better, more accountable person.</p>

    <!-- Different levels of squash -->
    <h3>The Different Levels of Squash</h3>
    <p>There are four main levels of play: <em>junior squash</em>, <em>highschool squash</em>, <em>college squash</em>, and <em>professional squash</em>.</p>

    <div class="levels">
        <div class="same-width">
            <!-- Junior squash -->
            <h4>Junior Squash</h4>
            <p>In junior squash, there are five main divisions: <em>unders 11s</em>, <em>13s</em>, <em>15s</em>, <em>17s</em>, and <em>19s</em>. Thus, within a specific division each player has an 'off-year' and a 'main-year' depending on their age at the time. For example, if there was a 13 year old, this player would be in his 'off-year' having just moved up to the U15 division. The U11 and U13 divisions do not carry as much importance as the other three because of the young age of the players. Highschool coaches will begin to scout for players in the U15 division as potential players for their team. Once you reach the U17 and U19 divisions, most junior players are in discussions with college coaches about recruiting. Junior squash is a great way to grow and foster young talent.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="same-width">
            <!-- Highschool squash -->
            <h4>Highschool Squash</h4>
            <p>Highschool squash is somewhat a different type of competition because squash is played as a team sport. On a highschool squash team, there are seven players who play during the matches, thus, whichever the victorious team much consolidate at least four match wins. The structure of team squash introduces the team ladder. Players are ranked numbers 1 through 7 by whoever is best and each match results in one point for the team. This creates a unique aspect of squash because the number 7 match is just as important as the number 1 match. Something very exciting is that highschool squash is gaining considerable popularity every year as the competition improves. The highschool season builds up to Highschool Team Nationals where the top 16 teams in the country compete in Division A for the Justi Cup. This is quite an exciting event especially for highschool players.</p>

        <div class="same-width">
            <!-- College squash -->
            <h4>College Squash</h4>
            <p>At the college squash level, the level of player is miles better than highschool squash. When you think of it, all of the best highschool squash players are recruited to similar teams so there is fierce competition. However, there is a problem with the rankings of college squash. There is a considerable drop off between teams ranked 1 through 8, 9 through 16, 16 through 24, and so on. The level severely drops off. Despite this, teams ranked in the 20s still a have very high level of squash. To describe this more accurately, you can most closely compare college squash to be a professional level of squash. Most of the top college squahs players are already ranked in the professional squash tour and plan to play professionally after graduating. So while there is a large discrepancy between the best and worst teams, the level of play is undoubtedly very strong. College squash is also played as a team sport, however, instead of 7 players playing matches, 9 players will play during matches. Thus, the victorious team needs to win at least five of the nine matches. The college squash seasons build up to the National Championships in which the top eight teams will compete for the Potter Cup.</p>
